 * This example creates a test network. You do not need to have an Ad Manager
 * account to run this example, but you do need to have a Google account
 * (created at https://www.google.com/accounts/newaccount if you currently don't
 * have one) that is not associated with any other Ad Manager test networks.
 * Once this network is created, you can supply the network code in your
 * ads.properties file to make calls to other services.
 *
 * Alternatively, if you do not wish to run this example, you can create a test
 * network at: https://dfp-playground.appspot.com
 *
 * Please see the following URL for more information:
 * https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/docs/environments
 *
 * It is meant to be run from a command line (not as a webpage) and requires
 * that you've setup an `adsapi_php.ini` file in your home directory with your
 * API credentials and settings. See README.md for more info.
