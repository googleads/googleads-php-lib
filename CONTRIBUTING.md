## Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your code patches! However, before we can take them, we have
to clear a couple of legal hurdles.

*   Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License
    Agreement.

    *   If you are an individual writing original source code and are sure you
        own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an individual
        CLA available at:

        https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/individual

    *   If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your
        work to this client library, then you'll need to sign a corporate CLA
        available at:

        https://developers.google.com/open-source/cla/corporate

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and
instructions on how to sign and return it. Once we receive the CLA, we'll add
you to the official list of contributors and will be able to accept your
patches.

## Submitting Patches

*   Sign a Contributor License Agreement (see above).
*   Join the appropriate product discussion forum.
    *   AdWords API: https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/community/
    *   Ad Manager API: https://developers.google.com/ad-manager/community
    *   DFA API:
        https://developers.google.com/doubleclick-advertisers/reporting/community
*   Create an issue on the library issue tracker if there isn't one already. Use
    this issue to co-ordinate the changes with the library maintainer.
*   Fork the library using `git clone https://github.com/googleads/googleads-php-lib.git`,
    make the changes and send a [pull
    request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
*   The library maintainer will work with you to review and apply the patch.

## If you can't become a contributor

If you can't become a contributor, but wish to share some code that illustrates
an issue / shows how an issue may be fixed, then you can attach your changes on
the issue tracker. We will use this code to troubleshoot the issue and fix it,
but will not use this code in the library unless the steps to submit patches are
done.
